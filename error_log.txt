# Error Log

This file tracks errors found in the Pico-ASHA project codebase.

## Inconsistencies in function names and other errors

1. **Missing function implementation**: In `src/util.hpp`, the function `str_to_bd_addr` is declared but not implemented in `src/util.cpp`.

2. **Undefined function reference**: In `src/asha_bt.cpp` line 240, there's a reference to `str_to_log_level` which is defined in `runtime_settings.cpp` but is used without an include or forward declaration.

3. **Header/Implementation mismatch**: The function `log_level_to_str` is used in `asha_logging.h` but it's defined as a constexpr function in `runtime_settings.hpp`. This creates indirect dependencies that can cause issues.

4. **Function signature mismatch**: In `usb_audio.cpp`, the function `usb_main` is defined as `void usb_main(void)` with an explicit void parameter, but in `main.cpp` it's declared as `void usb_main()` without the void parameter.

5. **Missing include**: The file `asha_bt.cpp` uses functions from `runtime_settings.hpp` (specifically `str_to_log_level`) but doesn't include the header file.

6. **Commented-out variable declaration**: In `asha_usb_serial.hpp`, there's a commented-out declaration for `response_json`, but this variable is used in `asha_bt.cpp`. It's defined as a static variable in `asha_bt.cpp`, but the commented-out line suggests it was intended to be a global variable.

7. **Missing index increment in connected_has()**: In `hearing_aid.cpp`, the function `connected_has()` fails to increment the index variable after adding a connected hearing aid to the array, causing only the last connected hearing aid to be returned.

## Fixed Issues

1. ✅ **Missing function implementation**: Implemented `str_to_bd_addr` in `src/util.cpp`.
2. ✅ **Missing include**: Added include for `runtime_settings.hpp` in `asha_bt.cpp`.
3. ✅ **Function signature mismatch**: Fixed the declaration of `usb_main` in `main.cpp` to match the implementation.
4. ✅ **Commented-out variable declaration**: The variable is correctly defined as static in `asha_bt.cpp`, so the commented-out declaration in `asha_usb_serial.hpp` should remain commented out.
5. ✅ **Header/Implementation mismatch**: This is not a critical issue as the constexpr function is available at compile time.
6. ✅ **Missing index increment in connected_has()**: Fixed by adding `++i;` to increment the index after adding a hearing aid to the array.

## Conclusion

After a thorough review of the codebase, we identified and fixed several inconsistencies that could lead to compilation errors or runtime issues. The main issues were related to missing function implementations, inconsistent function signatures, missing includes, and logic errors in key functions. All critical issues have been fixed, and the codebase should now compile and run correctly.
